A React app to track your game library and get recommendations based on your tastes and preferences

## How to Use
A user can sign up for an account to maintain their video game library and get an idea of their taste preferences and easily track their collection. Add games typing one or more titles into the search bar. All game data is sourced from the Giant Bomb API. 

After adding games, users can assign their games a star rating between 1 and 5. They can also set the status of a game, to denote whether they're currently playing it, haven't started yet, have completed it, or don't own the game yet but want it on their wishlist. Games can also be removed from the library by clicking the delete button in the lower left hand corner. 

Finally, users can view stats about their library such as their favorite genres or the average raring that a game has. They can also filter visibility of games based on some of the more popular consoles and game platforms from the top right. Users may sort their library by name, release date, and date of addition to the library from the top right as well.
